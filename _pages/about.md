I am currently a postdoc in the [Climate Change Research Centre](http://www.ccrc.unsw.edu.au/) at the ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate Extremes [CLEX](https://climateextremes.org.au/).

My research is mostly focused on how climate affects ecosystem processes in tropical and subtropical forests.
